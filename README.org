* Cookiedough

A click-enabled CLI for cookiecutter

* Goals

Support a single cookiecutter database of project ingredients and a cookiedough.json for composing a recipe from those ingredients.

Manage the developer dependencies independently of the system site-packages and the virtual environnment dependencies, in ~/.local

Provide a more robust event model, so that the virtual environment can be configured ahead of cookiecutter execution
